## Beginner: Understanding SSL/TLS and Pinning

	1.	SSL/TLS Basics:
	•	SSL/TLS provides encrypted communication between clients (like an iOS app) and servers.
	•	During the handshake process, the server presents a certificate that the client validates against known Certificate Authorities (CAs).
	2.	What is SSL Pinning?:
	•	SSL pinning in iOS involves embedding the server’s certificate or public key within the app.
	•	The app then verifies the server’s identity by matching the server’s certificate or public key against the embedded one.

## Intermediate: Implementing SSL Pinning in iOS

	3.	Types of Pinning:
	•	Certificate Pinning: Embedding the server’s entire certificate in the app. More secure but less flexible.
	•	Public Key Pinning: Embedding just the public key. Offers more flexibility.
	4.	Implementing Pinning:
	•	NSURLSession and URLSessionDelegate: Use these for network requests and to handle the SSL pinning logic within the delegate methods.
	•	Third-party Libraries: Libraries like Alamofire can simplify the implementation.

## Advanced: Technical Details and Best Practices

	5.	Handling Certificate Changes:
	•	Plan for certificate renewals. The app must be updated if the pinned certificate changes.
	6.	Security Considerations:
	•	Understand the risks of man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks and how SSL pinning mitigates them.
	•	Be aware of potential vulnerabilities in your pinning implementation.
	7.	Testing and Deployment:
	•	Rigorously test SSL pinning logic.
	•	Monitor for certificate expiration and updates.

## Expert: Advanced Strategies and Challenges

	8.	Dynamic Pinning:
	•	Consider implementing dynamic pinning strategies, allowing the app to update pins without a full update.
	9.	Fallback Mechanisms:
	•	Implement a strategy for handling failures in pinning, like a temporary bypass mechanism during certificate transitions.
	10.	Network Security Framework (NSF):

	•	Explore Apple’s Network Security Framework for advanced security options and configurations.

	11.	Troubleshooting and Debugging:

	•	Be prepared to troubleshoot issues related to SSL pinning, which can be complex and difficult to debug.

	12.	Legal and Compliance Aspects:

	•	Ensure compliance with privacy laws and export regulations.

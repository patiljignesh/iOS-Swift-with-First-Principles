###### DispatchQueue
- An object that manages the execution of tasks serially or concurrently on your app's main thread or on a background thread.

###### Design Pattern: MVC
###### UI Element Positioning

###### Defining Structure
- struct MyStruct {...}
- Call/Initialise by: MyStruct()
- Has to start with a Capital Letter since we are defining our own Data Type
- Example:
```
struct Town {
   let name: "Paris Land"
   var citizen = ["PersonOne","PersonTwo","PersonThree"]
   var resources = ["Grain" : 100, "Ore" : 42, "Wool" : 75 ]
}
```

Snippet of Info:
```
1. IBOutlet - Interface Builder Outlet 
2. Who.What = Value
3. IBOutlet = Actions are from Code to Design
4. IBAction = Actions are from Design to Code ```
5. ``` Random Number = **Int.random(in: 0...5)** ```
6. Random Element in an ``` Array = arrayVar.randomElement() ```
7. ``` func myFunction(parameter: DataType) { ... } ```

## Weak Self 

Simple Explanation with Code

	•	Scenario: Imagine you have a class that starts a network request. When the request finishes, it needs to update the class.
	•	Problem: If the network request holds a strong reference to the class (self), and the class holds a strong reference to the request, they can keep each other in memory even when they should be deleted.
	•	Solution: Use weak self in the closure to prevent this.

```
class MyClass {
    func fetchData() {
        NetworkRequest.fetchData { [weak self] result in
            // 'self' is now a weak reference
            self?.updateData(result)
        }
    }

    func updateData(_ data: Data) {
        // Update the data
    }
}
```

Intermediate Explanation with Code

	•	Strong Reference: Normally, self in a closure increases the reference count.
	•	Using weak self: Changes self to a weak reference, not increasing the reference count.

```
class MyClass {
    var property: String = "Hello"

    func doSomething() {
        SomeAsyncOperation { [weak self] in
            // 'self' might be nil here if MyClass instance is deallocated
            print(self?.property ?? "Default Value")
        }
    }
}
```

Complex Explanation with Code

	•	Retain Cycles: When two objects strongly reference each other, they can create a retain cycle.
	•	Breaking the Cycle: weak self in a closure inside one of these objects prevents the cycle.

```
class NetworkManager {
    var completion: (() -> Void)?

    func fetchData() {
        completion = { [weak self] in
            // This closure does not increase the reference count of 'self'
            self?.handleData()
        }
    }

    func handleData() {
        // Handle the data
    }

    deinit {
        print("NetworkManager is being deinitialized")
    }
}

class ViewController {
    var networkManager = NetworkManager()

    func loadData() {
        networkManager.fetchData()
    }

    deinit {
        print("ViewController is being deinitialized")
    }
}

```

In this example, if weak self were not used, NetworkManager and ViewController would strongly reference each other (through the completion closure and the networkManager property, respectively), potentially leading to a memory leak. By using weak self, we ensure that the closure does not prevent the NetworkManager from being deinitialized when it is no longer needed.

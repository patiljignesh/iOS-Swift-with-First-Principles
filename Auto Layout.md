# Auto Layout

## Three known types

1. Interface Builder
2. Using Visual Format Language
3. Anchors

## Summary 
- Create user interfaces that automatically adjust size and position based on the screen size and orientation.
- Stack views are a convenient way to manage a collection of views in either horizontal or vertical stacks, reducing the complexity of constraints.
- Not all constraints are equal. You can set priority levels to dictate which constraints should be considered more important if conflicts arise.
- Dynamic Layout:
  - Auto Layout can adjust to different screen sizes and orientations, making your app look good on any device.
- Size Classes:
  - These allow for more granular control, enabling different layouts for different device types (like compact width on an iPhone vs. regular width on an iPad).
